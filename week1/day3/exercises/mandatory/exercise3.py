#ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3 : Whoâ€™s the song producer?
#Step 1: Create the Song Class

#Create a class called Song.
#In the __init__ method, take lyrics (a list) as a parameter and create a corresponding attribute.
#Create a sing_me_a_song() method that prints each element of the lyrics list on a new line.
class Song:
    def __init__(self,Lyrics):
        self.lyrics = Lyrics
    def sing_me_a_song(self):
        for line in self.lyrics:
            print(line)
stairway = Song(["Thereâ€™s a lady who's sure", "all that glitters is gold", "and sheâ€™s buying a stairway to heaven"])
stairway.sing_me_a_song()
