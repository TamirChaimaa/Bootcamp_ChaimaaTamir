#ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Tall enough to ride a roller coaster
# 1 Write code that will ask the user for their height in centimeters.
# 2 If they are over 145cm print a message that states they are tall enough to ride.
# 3 If they are not tall enough print a message that says they need to grow some more to ride.
height = int(input("How tall are you in cm? "))
if height >= 145:
    print("Great! You're tall enough to enjoy the roller coaster.")
else:
    print("Oops! You need to grow a bit more before you can ride the roller coaster.")
